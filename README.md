# wildfire-analysis
The project aims to visualize wildfire activity in Oregon, exploring related data to create visualizations and tables to analyze the historical patterns.

Please note that hex.tech was used as the notebook/IDE for this project, and so the code may require some adjustments to run on DatasSpell or other programs.
